# My Recipe Keeper

## Project Purpose
As the the second portfolio project for Flatiron School, I need to create a single page application using React and React Router to navigate among the components, as well as make RESTful API calls. 

## Project Description
When first accessing the site, the user sees a navigation screen allowing them to havigate among several components
- Home Page: Allows users to randomly generate a menu based on a selection of available recipes
- Appetizers, Sides, Mains, Desserts: Allows users to view all recipes of a single type
- Add Something New: A form that allows a user to input a new recipe

In both the home page as well as the recipe type pages, users will see a list of recipe cards contianing the recipe title, a reference photo, and a list of required ingredients. Clicking on the card will navigate the user to the full details of the recipe, where they also have the option to either edit or delete the recipe.
